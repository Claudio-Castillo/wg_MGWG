### Objectives

- Make sure we continue to work together on the projects, after we leave Ispra

- Present, write papers, party!

### Challenges

- We have lots of other things to do

- We tend to prioritize things that (a) our boss asks us to do, (b) have a clear
  deadline, or (c) we find simple and straightforward.

### Solutions

- Slice project into tasks, then slice each task into smaller bite-size jobs
  (bits)

- Assign people and deadlines to bits

- Schedule online meetings with group (monthly) and everybody (quarterly)

- Present findings at symposia (ICES, WFC, ICES)

- Tally beer points for bits completed

### To do

- Look into ICES (2019/2020), WFC (2020), ISEC (2020) conferences, submission
  deadlines, existing theme sessions, etc.
