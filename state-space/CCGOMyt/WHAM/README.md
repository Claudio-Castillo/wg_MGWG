### WHAM model fit details

Using age-specific selectivity for the survey facilitated convergence. 
Trial fits with all age-specific selectivities free, led to  peak selectivity at age 3,2 for indices 2,4 in models 1 and 2
Peak selectivity for index 4 was at age 2 in models 3 and 4

Model 4 is used to provide results for comparison with other model frameworks.
