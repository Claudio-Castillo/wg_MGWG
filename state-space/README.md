### State-space vs. traditional models

(T Miller)

Comparison of merits and issues for traditional SCAA and state-space
age-structured models. This could include different varieties of each class of
models.

Perhaps we can contribute:

* Recommended diagnostics for process error terms: plots, thresholds, etc.

Another working group already working on this?    | Not likely
How can this be structured into a journal paper?  | Part I: Apply various models to real data for stocks that have bad retrospective patterns. Stocks to tackle: SNE yellowtail flounder, GB yellowtail flounder, (US) Atlantic herring, Icelandic herring, North Sea cod (no retro, control), other European stocks TBD, New Zealand stock TBD. Also forecasting ability of different models for stock with and without retrospective patterns. Part II: Simulation study with different sources of model mis-specficiation and fit various models to these simulated data. The possible models to fit to real or simulated data are: SAM, Miller model, ASAP, SS3, VPA, a4a. Factors to consider in simulation study scenarios: Mis-specification of catch, q, M, precision of catch or indices. Quantify uncertainty in Mohn's rho?
What kind of work is required, and how much work? | Part II: Simulate data for each scenario using Miller and/or SAM state-space models.
