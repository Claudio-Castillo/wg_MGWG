### WHAM model fit details

Using age-specific selectivity for the catch and two surveys facilitated convergence. 
Trial fits with all age-specific selectivities free, led to  peak selectivities at age 7 for the catch,
and ages 4 and 6 for surveys. This was consistent for all 4 fitted models. 

Model 4 is used to provide results for comparison with other model frameworks.
