### WHAM model fit details

Using age-specific selectivity for the surveys facilitated convergence. 
Trial fits with all age-specific selectivities free, led to  peak selectivity at ages 5  for index 1 and 3 for index 2,
This was consistent for all 4 fitted models. 

Model 3 is used to provide results for comparison with other model frameworks.
