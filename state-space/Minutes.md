### Minutes for Skype calls of the State-space group

## 18 October 2018
Attendees:   Tim Miller, Jon Deroba, Vanessa Trijoulet, Chris Legault, Anders Nielsen, Arni Magnusson, Kelli Johnson, 
  Niels Hintzen, Ernesto Jardim

Kelli J. and Cole M. are going to do SS3 fits starting with the priority species in the table. Need to develop some R code to write input
files for SS3 from.

Tim M. will check Icelandic herring files for some age range issues. Chris L. is waiting for this to do ASAP fits for this stock. 
Anders, Tim, and Ernesto may have to rerun depending on the problem.

Ernesto J. will work on getting forecasted indices for a4a scaa models.

All those collaborators that are fitting models need to get text together describing the general models and the specifications for each 
stock.

Tim M. and Anders N. will work on synthesizing the model descriptions to make a consise section (removing redundancies) describing 
all models.

Vanessa T. and Chris L. will figure out how to summarize/plot the results across models.

Some confusion about the goal of this project and importance of retrospective patterns/Mohn's rho for comparing models. Arni M.
provided a summary that he has given to ICES ACOM, etc.

Vanessa T. and Arni M. will come up with ideas for a structure of the introduction.

Next call is 15 November 2018 at 10am (EST, UTC-5) 


## 15 November 2018
Attendees: Tim Miller, Jon Deroba, Niels Hintzen, Anders Nielsen, Casper Berg, Vanessa Trijoulet

Kelli has been working on a ASAP to SS3 converter.

Chris has done work in DB directory summarizing results. Some questions on the last two plots in particular.

Tim sorted out the issue with Iceland herring data. Just a problem for WHAM and ASAP because the converter was not set up right.

Vanessa has done some work to structure the paper and added suggested paragraph topics.

Those on the call like the idea of also doing model comparisons within model type. Refer back MGWG work where SAM was set up to mimic XSA. Methods for comparing models within model type could include AIC as well as Mohn's rho and survey observation prediction.

Casper brought up trying to get a handle on uncertainty in RMSE. Need to define what type of uncertainty (e.g., variability between stocks?) and then think about how to estimate it.

Forgot to bring up making a decision on what to do about surveys missing last three years (if it is an issue at all). 

## 20 December 2018
Attendees: Tim Miller, Jon Deroba, Chris Legault, Anders Nielsen, Casper Berg, Vanessa Trijoulet, Ernesto Jardim, Kelli Johnson

Tim has specified which WHAM models he will fit for each of the stocks. This is complete for US herring, now for the rest.

We decided that perhaps best to have details/equations for each model in an appendix/supplementary materials and describe differences in main text.

Ernesto would like us to try to get this submitted for review by this summer ideally. Everyone needs to give this some thought and see if it is possible with what is already on their calendar in the first half of 2019. We will revisit this on the next call.

## 17 January 2019
Attendees: None. 

Meeting did not occur due to the US Goverment shutdown.

## 21 February 2019
Attendees: Ernesto, Casper, Anders, Vanessa, Tim, Chris

Tim has completed WHAM fits for all stocks and edited text in draft manuscript.

Ernesto will not have time until late spring/early summer to finish predicted indices results for A4A models.

Casper will determine a consistent set of SAM models to fit to the stocks.

## 21 March 2019
Attendees: Kelli, Brian Stock, Arni, Tim

Tim has put WHAM model on github: https://github.com/timjmiller/wham

Cole M. will not be able to contribute to the project due to other commitments. Kelli will try to take up SS3 work. Perhaps Jon D. can help?

Arni M. has submitted an ICES ASC abstract for the project. He will work on generating draft presentation slides from material on the github site.

Colin messaged that he will help Ernesto with getting the A4A predicted indices results fixed up.

## 18 April 2019
Attendees: Tim, Kelli

Kelli has made progress on code to convert ASAP files to SS3! Focused primarily on North Sea cod to test the conversion code. Once that is complete, application to other stocks should be straightforward.
