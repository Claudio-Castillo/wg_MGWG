Kelli J. and Cole M. are going to do SS3 fits starting with the priority species in the table. Need to develop some R code to write input
files for SS3 from.

Tim M. will check Icelandic herring files for some age range issues. Chris L. is waiting for this to do ASAP fits for this stock. 
Anders, Tim, and Ernesto may have to rerun depending on the problem.

Ernesto J. will work on getting forecasted indices for a4a scaa models.

All those collaborators that are fitting models need to get text together describing the general models and the specifications for each 
stock.

Tim M. and Anders N. will work on synthesizing the model descriptions to make a consise section (removing redundancies) describing 
all models.

Vanessa T. and Chris L. will figure out how to summarize/plot the results across models.

Some confusion about the goal of this project and importance of retrospective patterns/Mohn's rho for comparing models. Arni M.
provided a summary that he has given to ICES ACOM, etc.

Vanessa T. and Arni M. will come up with ideas for a structure of the introduction.

Next call is 15 November 2018 at 10am (EST, UTC-5)
