### WHAM model fit details

Using age-specific selectivity for the survey facilitated convergence. 
Trial fits with all age-specific selectivities free, led to  peak selectivity at age 4,2,5 for indices 1,2,3 in model 1
Peak selectivity for index 1,2,3 was at ages 3,2,3 in model 2
Peak selectivity for index 1,2,3 was at ages 2,2,3 in models 3 and 4

Model 4 is used to provide results for comparison with other model frameworks.
