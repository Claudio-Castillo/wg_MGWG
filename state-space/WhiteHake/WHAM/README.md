### WHAM model fit details

Using age-specific selectivity for the survey facilitated convergence for model 1 only. 
Trial fits with all age-specific selectivities free, led to  peak selectivity at age 3 for indices 2 in model 1

Model 4 is used to provide results for comparison with other model frameworks.
In peel 7 for Model 4 observation error variance estimate for index 2 goes to 0.
