### WHAM model fit details

Using age-specific selectivity for the survey facilitated convergence. 
Trial fits with all age-specific selectivities free, led to  peak selectivity at age 7,5,1 for indices 1,2,3.
This was consistent for all 4 fitted models.

Model 4 is used to provide results for comparison with other model frameworks.
