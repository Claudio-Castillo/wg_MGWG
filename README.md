# ICES Methods Working Group

## Letter of Invitation

Dear stock assessment experts,

The brand new ICES Methods Working Group will be meeting **13-17 November 2017
in Woods Hole**, and you are invited to attend!

As the Chair of the new WG, my goal is to bring together the best stock
assessment modellers from Europe, North America and elsewhere, to do good
science and have fun together. As a group, we will decide for ourselves which
research topics to pursue. The only message from the ICES leadership to the
group is: aim high and publish your findings.

The objectives of the working group are:

1. Develop and improve stock assessment models and techniques
2. Leverage the international scope of the WG to analyze many models and datasets
3. Publish multi-author papers related to stock assessment

The focus will mainly be on single-species models, diagnostics, forecasts,
uncertainty, statistical techniques, innovations, etc.

Specific objectives of this first meeting of the new Methods WG are:

* Identify main research topics
* Form teams
* Formulate papers to publish

We will be especially interested in topics that bring together and compare a
wide range of approaches, methods, and datasets.

I realize that 13-17 November is very close, and I apologize for the short
notice. If you are interested but unable to attend this first meeting, do not
despair: the Methods WG will meet annually and the 2018 meeting will be
announced with proper notice. Furthermore, feel free to participate remotely by
proposing research topics and shape the ideas that will continue to develop.

We can start some brainstorming in the weeks before the meeting, but at this
point I want to invite you to participate in the ICES Methods WG. Feel free to
forward the invitation to those you think might be interested. Registration is
simple, just send me an email!

All the best,

Arni
