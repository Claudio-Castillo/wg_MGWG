### Working Title

Time-varying selectivity

### Participants

  * Kelli Johnson, NWFSC
  * Tim Miller, NEFSC
  * Chris Legault, NEFSC
  * Brian Stock, NEFSC
  * Claudio Castillo-Jordan, UW
  * Rick Methot, NWFSC

### Background

Many factors can cause selectivity to change over time (e.g. changes in regulations, growth, and spatial distributions of stocks or fishing effort), and assessment frameworks provide scientists with a range of options to allow for time-varying selectivity. Not allowing modelled selectivity to change when changes have occurred in reality can result in biased estimates of key parameters. Including too much flexibility to estimate time-varying selectivity, however, can also come at a cost. Guidance on when and how to allow for time-varying selectivity is needed and should be based on expected effects on assessment output (accuracy and precision of reference points, catch advice)

##### Questions

* What are the tradeoffs in catch advice vs. model fit? How do you set reference points? Possible that fitting the data better does not result in better management (e.g. could increase uncertainty of forecasts)
* Are time blocks effectively created by the more flexible approaches? And what is the precision tradeoff?
* How does the answer depend on informativeness of survey vs. catch data?
* Time-varying M and selectivity at the same time?

### Objectives

This project will leverage work from the state-space project. We will use the same 13 stocks (data already compiled):

  * North Sea cod (Nscod)
  * Gulf of Maine Cod (GOMcod)
  * Georges Bank Haddock (GBhaddock)
  * Gulf of Maine Haddock (GOMhaddock)
  * US Pollock
  * Southern New England-Mid-Atlantic yellowtail (SNEMAYT)
  * Cape Cod-Gulf of Maine yellowtail (CCGOMYT)
  * Georges Bank winter flounder
  * Southern New England-Mid-Atlantic winter flounder (SNEMAwinter)
  * American Plaice
  * White Hake
  * Icelandic herring (ICEherring)
  * US Atlantic Herring (USAtlHerring)
