SAM fit with default settings other than estimation of Beverton Holt.  Steepness and reference points estimated using the terminal year life history values.  Initial model fits failed to converge because the process variance in survival was being estimated as 0, which although is correct, created issues.  So, I added some lognormal noise to the catch observations until the model converged.  The process variance on survival is still very near zero and retrospective peels failed to converge.  Diagnostics look OK, but there is a consistent difference between the truth and estimation.  I wonder if the difference between the truth and the estimate may also be due to the OM not having any process noise in survival.  Given time, I'll try to turn off estimation of process variance in survival and try again.
