### Minutes for Skype calls of the stock-recruit group

## 31 October 2018
Attendees:   Jon Deroba, Chris Legault, Liz Brooks, Dvora Hart, Colin Millar, Arni

We clarified and refined the objectives for this research and these have been added to the github repository.  Mostly for Jon's sake, we reviewed progress made in Ispra.

Iago could not be on the call, but we corresponded via email and he agreed to develop a common operating model to be used for data generation.  Colin agreed to assist with this as needed.  Developing this operating model and generating data is a crucial first step because no other work can advance without it.

Someone (Jon?) needs to followup with Noel Cadigan to see if he is able to fully participate.  He has at least offered some code to conduct external estimation of stock recruit relationships.

Jon will clean the github site a bit and post minutes.

Jon will setup the next meeting, but will wait for some progress on operating model development so that we can report something signigicant on the next call.

## June 17-21
Attendees: Jon Deroba, Liz Brooks, Iago,

Agenda:

Update everyone about progress (Jon: data generated, test case, rough plan)

Review the git site (Iago, Liz: what is in each folder, how is it formatted, Iago is tracking the truth to be revealed later)

Review needed ouputs from assessment models and standard output formats (Iago, Liz, Colin, Jon)

Next steps and timing

Anything else?
