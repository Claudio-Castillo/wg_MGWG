# Selectivity as part of management advice

## Initial thoughts

Looking across many stocks of Atlantic cod, we see very different selectivities:
some are fished mainly at ages 1-3, other stocks mainly at ages 4-8. This has
not been the result of scientific advice, but gear regulations that have evolved
in each region.

Can this be considered mismanagement of some of these cod stocks, in the form of
underutilizing or risking stock collapse? Or are the different selectivities
quite sensible, given the growth and maturity ogives for the respective stocks?

Quick paper: Gather three matrices for each Atlantic cod stock: selectivity,
weight, and maturity at age. Sketch and discuss the findings, perhaps analyzing
what would happen if selectivity A would be applied to stock B.

What is the problem we are trying to solve? | What are the long-term impacts of a given selectivity pattern? What should selectivity be optimized for? (Yield, economics, sustainability, CPUE) Which fisheries are not using an optimal selectivity pattern and what are the impacts of these decisions? Does using too large of an age plus group mask important nuances of selectivity patterns?

"Currently, MSY and FMSY are usually calculated keeping selectivity constant (ICES 2011). Our meta-analysis, in line with previous stock-specific studies (e.g. Froese et al. 2008; Scott and Sampson 2011; Colloca et al. 2013), suggests that this traditional calcula- tion of MSY is very restrictive in that it ignores the higher MSYs that can be extracted by shifting selectivity towards older/larger fish."
