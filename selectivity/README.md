# Selectivity as part of management advice

## Initial thoughts

Looking across many stocks of Atlantic cod, we see very different selectivities:
some are fished mainly at ages 1-3, other stocks mainly at ages 4-8. This has
not been the result of scientific advice, but gear regulations that have evolved
in each region.

Can this be considered mismanagement of some of these cod stocks, in the form of
underutilizing or risking stock collapse? Or are the different selectivities
quite sensible, given the growth and maturity ogives for the respective stocks?

Quick paper: Gather three matrices for each Atlantic cod stock: selectivity,
weight, and maturity at age. Sketch and discuss the findings, perhaps analyzing
what would happen if selectivity A would be applied to stock B.
