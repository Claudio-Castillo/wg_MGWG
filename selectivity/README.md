## Background

Looking across many stocks of Atlantic cod, we see very different selectivities:
some are fished mainly at ages 1-3, other stocks mainly at ages 4-8. This has
not been the result of scientific advice, but gear regulations that have evolved
in each region.

Can this be considered mismanagement of some of these cod stocks, in the form of
underutilizing or risking stock collapse? Or are the different selectivities
quite sensible, given the growth and maturity ogives for the respective stocks?

## Objective

To evaluate whether some Atlantic cod fisheries could be improved (in terms of
long-term yield, sustainability, precautionary approach, etc.) by changing the
selectivity. In other words, provide an analytical foundation that could lead to
scientific advice to change gear regulations.

With relatively little amount of work, we can give an important and useful
summary/comparison of many Atlantic cod fisheries. A follow-up study could
repeat the analysis for different species found in mixed fisheries on a regional
basis.

Research questions:

* What are the long-term impacts of a given selectivity pattern?

* What should selectivity be optimized for? (Yield, economics, sustainability,
  CPUE)

* Which fisheries are not using an optimal selectivity pattern and what are the
  impacts of these decisions?

* Does using too young of an age plus group mask important nuances of
  selectivity patterns?

## Plan

1. Gather data for as many Atlantic cod stocks as possible (by year and age):
   * Weight
   * Maturity
   * Natural mortality
   * Fishing mortality
   * Population numbers

2. Within-stock analysis:
   * Calculate averages - weight, maturity, selectivity, recruitment
   * Biomass of average cohort, in the absence of fishing (barplot)
   * Identify optimal age of harvest (highest column in barplot)
   * Compare with selectivity
   * Calculate optimal Fbar for this stock, given constant recruitment
   * Evaluate how selectivity could be changed to improve this cod fishery

3. Across-stocks analysis:
   * Compare stocks A and B, be evaluate how things would change if selectivity
     A would be applied to stock B

"Currently, MSY and FMSY are usually calculated keeping selectivity constant (ICES 2011). Our meta-analysis, in line with previous stock-specific studies (e.g. Froese et al. 2008; Scott and Sampson 2011; Colloca et al. 2013), suggests that this traditional calculation of MSY is very restrictive in that it ignores the higher MSYs that can be extracted by shifting selectivity towards older/larger fish."
