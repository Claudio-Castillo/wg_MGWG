# Skype meeting minutes

Second Thursday of every month

## 11 Oct 2018

Alejandro, Arni, Cecilia, Jacob, Paris

**Agenda**

1. Examine, summarize, and interpret the results so far
2. Review gaps in data, identify stocks that could be added
3. Status update on side stories (Lopt, Norwegian literature, historical changes)
4. Prepare a list of next tasks, decide who will report on what next meeting

**Action items**

To be presented at next meeting

- Take a closer look at which cod fisheries active today? [Arni]

- Add natural mortality in data folder [Jacob]

- Experiment with `applyFmax`: what is the potential yield of the Icelandic cod
  given the (1) current selectivity, (2) current selectivity shifted one age
  younger, and (3) current selectivity shifted one age higher? [Alejandro, Arni,
  Cecilia, Paris]

- Think about approaches other than applying Fmax or F0.1, e.g. applying
  Fcurrent but changing the selectivity. Given the F-at-age vector for the most
  recent year, how would the next year look if F at age 2 would decrease, for
  example? [Paris]

- Look into egg production / fecundity aspects. Might be practical to use one
  conversion for Atlantic cod as a species, same for all stocks. [Jacob]

- Compare selectivity with maturity. [Paris]

- Look at long-term trends in weight at age. How is it different to plot by
  cohort or year? Are neighboring regions showing similar trends? Is there an
  overall trend across the Atlantic? [Alejandro, Arni, Cecilia, Paris]
